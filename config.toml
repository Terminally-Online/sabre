[rapier]
# The listen address for Rapier. This is the address that Rapier will listen on
# for incoming requests. You can change this to any address you want, but make
# sure that the address is available and not used by any other service.
#
# It is recommended you run this on the same machine that consumes your node and
# not the machine that runs your node. This is because Rapier is designed to be a
# high-throughput caching layer that sits in front of your node, and it will
# perform better if it is running on the machine that can take advantage of
# local write/read speeds without the overhead of network latency.
listen = ":3000"
# The maximum number of times Rapier will retry a specific request across the 
# set of configured nodes before giving up. Since we burst-fire rather than 
# sequentially iterate, it is wise to set `max_retries` to 2 * the max number of 
# different RPCs you have on any given chain. For example, if you have 3 RPCs 
# configured for Ethereum, but only 1 RPC on Base, you should set `max_retries`
# to 6. This way, if the first RPC fails, Rapier will try the next one and so on,
# until it either succeeds or exhausts all the configured nodes.
#
# Out-of-the-box the default is set to the number of unique providers you have
# in your config at a 1:1 ratio. If you have 3 providers, it will make up to 
# 3 attempts. If you overwrite this, make sure to set it to a value that is
# greater than or equal to the number of unique providers you have configured.
max_attempts=3

[performance]
# The timeout for individual requests to backend nodes in milliseconds. This controls
# how long Rapier will wait for a response from a node before considering it failed.
# This should be set lower than your application's timeout requirements to ensure
# unhealthy backends are detected before they affect user requests.
timeout_ms = 2000
# The TTL for block cache in milliseconds. This is currently reserved for future
# subscription implementation and is not used in the current version. When subscriptions
# are implemented, this will control how long block data is cached.
ttl_block_ms = 13000
# The number of latency samples to maintain for each backend. Rapier tracks the
# last N request latencies to calculate average performance. A larger number provides
# more stable weighting but takes longer to adapt to performance changes. A smaller
# number adapts faster but may be more volatile. The default of 100 provides a good
# balance between stability and responsiveness.
#
# If a backend becomes unhealthy, Rapier will stop sending requests to it for a 
# period of time. A high number here does not prevent the ejection of a backend
# that is unhealthy and should not be included in the rotation.
samples = 100
# The gamma factor controls how aggressively Rapier prefers faster backends over
# slower ones. This value ranges from 0.0 to infinity, where:
# - gamma = 0.0: Equal weighting (no performance preference)
# - gamma = 0.5: Moderate preference for faster backends
# - gamma = 1.0: Linear preference (2x faster = 2x more traffic)
# - gamma = 2.0: Quadratic preference (2x faster = 4x more traffic)
# - gamma > 2.0: Very aggressive preference for fastest backends
#
# The formula used is: weight = (latency_ratio)^(-gamma)
# where latency_ratio = backend_latency / fastest_backend_latency
#
# A gamma of 0.9 provides a good balance between performance optimization and
# distribution, ensuring faster backends get more traffic while preventing
# complete starvation of slower but still functional backends.
gamma = 0.9
# This is the total number of connections that Rapier will keep open to all
# backends. If you have a single orchestrator, you can set this to 1. If you are
# not sure what you should have this set to, you can leave it at the default.
max_idle_conns = 8192
# The maximum number of idle connections to maintain per individual backend host.
# This prevents any single slow or problematic backend from monopolizing the connection
# pool. If you have a single orchestrator, you can set this to 1. If you are not sure
# what you should have this set to, you can leave it at the default like all others.
max_idle_conns_per_host = 2048
# How long to keep idle connections open before closing them (in milliseconds).
# Longer durations improve connection reuse but may hold onto connections to
# backends that are no longer needed. 90 seconds balances reuse with resource cleanup.
idle_conn_timeout_ms = 90000
# Whether to disable HTTP keep-alives entirely. When set to true, every request
# creates a new connection, significantly increasing latency and resource usage.
# Only disable this for debugging connection-related issues.
disable_keep_alives = false
# Whether to enable HTTP/2 support for backend connections. HTTP/2 multiplexing
# allows multiple concurrent requests over a single connection, reducing connection
# overhead and improving performance.
enable_http2 = true
# The maximum number of concurrent streams per HTTP/2 connection. Higher values
# allow more concurrent requests per connection but may overwhelm slower backends.
# 250 provides good concurrency while preventing backend overload. For most
# Terminally Online use cases, we run with a far lower ~30, but it's up to you.
# An over-provisioned value is better than an under-provisioned value here.
max_concurrent_streams = 250
# Whether to enable HTTP compression (gzip/deflate) for requests and responses.
# Compression typically reduces JSON-RPC payload sizes by 60-80%, significantly
# improving performance over slower network connections at minimal CPU cost.
#
# If you are running Rapier on a machine that has a lot of memory, you can set
# this to true and set the compression level to a higher value. If you are running
# Rapier on a machine that has a lot of CPU, you can set this to false and set
# the compression level to a lower value.
enable_compression = true
# Compression level from 1 (fastest, least compression) to 9 (slowest, best compression).
# Level 6 provides an excellent balance between compression ratio and CPU usage.
# Consider lower values (3-4) for CPU-constrained environments or higher values (7-8)
# when bandwidth is severely limited.
compression_level = 6

[batch]
# Enable automatic request batching to reduce network overhead and improve throughput.
# When enabled, Rapier will group multiple incoming requests to the same backend into
# batches, reducing the number of HTTP connections and improving overall performance.
# Batching is most effective when you have high request volume to the same backends.
enabled = true
# The maximum number of requests to include in a single batch. Larger batches
# provide better throughput but may increase latency for individual requests.
# A value of 10 provides a good balance between throughput and responsiveness.
max_batch_size = 10
# The maximum time to wait before processing a batch (in milliseconds). This
# controls how long Rapier waits for more requests to arrive before sending
# the current batch. Lower values reduce latency but may result in smaller
# batches and lower throughput. 50ms provides a good balance.
max_batch_wait_ms = 50
# The maximum number of concurrent batch workers per backend. Each worker
# processes batches independently, allowing multiple batches to be sent
# simultaneously. Higher values increase concurrency but may overwhelm
# slower backends. 4 workers provide good concurrency without overloading.
max_batch_workers = 4

# Health checking allows Rapier to automatically detect and route around unhealthy
# backend nodes. When enabled, Rapier will periodically send health check requests
# to each configured backend to ensure they are responding correctly. If a backend
# fails multiple consecutive health checks, it will be temporarily removed from
# the load balancer rotation until it passes health checks again.
[health]
# Enable or disable health checking for all backends. When disabled, all backends
# are considered healthy and will receive traffic regardless of their actual status.
# This is useful for testing or when you want to manually control backend availability.
enabled = true
# The interval between health check requests in milliseconds. Health checks are
# sent to each backend at this frequency to monitor their responsiveness. A lower
# value provides faster failure detection but increases overhead. A higher value
# reduces overhead but may delay detection of backend failures.
ttl_check_ms = 1000
# The maximum time to wait for a health check response in milliseconds. If a
# backend doesn't respond within this timeout, the health check is considered
# failed. This should be set lower than your application's timeout requirements
# to ensure unhealthy backends are detected before they affect user requests.
timeout_ms = 1500
# The number of consecutive failed health checks required before a backend is
# marked as unhealthy and removed from the load balancer rotation. This prevents
# temporary network hiccups from immediately taking backends offline. A higher
# value makes the system more tolerant of intermittent failures but may delay
# response to actual backend issues.
fails_to_down = 2
# The number of consecutive successful health checks required before a previously
# unhealthy backend is marked as healthy and returned to the load balancer
# rotation. This ensures that backends are fully recovered before receiving
# production traffic again.
passes_to_up = 2
# The JSON-RPC method to use for health checks. This method should be lightweight
# and commonly supported by all Ethereum nodes. The default "eth_blockNumber" is
# ideal as it's a simple read operation that doesn't require parameters and
# provides a good indication that the node is functioning properly.
method = "eth_blockNumber"

[cache]
# The cache is enabled by default, but you can disable it if you want to run
# Rapier without caching. This is useful for testing or debugging purposes.
# If you disable the cache, Rapier will still work, but it will be slower and
# will make more requests to the node.
enabled = true
# The path to the cache directory. This is where Rapier will store the cached
# data. You can change this to any directory you want, but make sure that the
# directory exists and is writable by the user running Rapier. If you want to 
# bootstrap Prometheus metrics on top of Rapier, you can set this to a directory
# that is mounted to a persistent volume in your container or VM.
path = "./.data/rapier"
# The clean flag controls whether Rapier should clean up old cache files on startup.
# When set to true, Rapier will remove any cached data that has expired or is no
# longer valid, ensuring a fresh start and preventing cache corruption issues. 
# This is particularly useful in development environments or when you want to
# ensure you're getting the most up-to-date data from your nodes.
#
# Set this to false if you want to preserve all cached data across restarts,
# which can be beneficial for production environments where you want to maintain
# cache performance and reduce initial load times.
clean = true
# Maximum depth of re-orgs to protect against (in blocks).
# This determines:
# 1. How many recent block hashes to keep in memory for comparison
# 2. How far back to validate cached data against known block hashes
# 3. The threshold for considering blocks "stable" vs "recent"
# A value of 100 means we'll track the last 100 blocks and be conservative
# with data from recent blocks. Higher values provide better protection
# but use more memory and may reduce cache effectiveness.
max_reorg_depth = 100
# The maximum number of entries in the cache. This is the maximum number of
# entries that Rapier will keep in memory. If the cache exceeds this limit,
# Rapier will evict the least recently used entries. You can change this to any
# number you want, but keep in mind that a larger cache will use more memory.
# Modern computers have plenty of memory, so you can set this to a large number
# if you want to keep more entries in the cache.
mem_entries = 100000
# The TTL for the latest block cache is set to 250ms, which is sufficient for
# most use cases. If you are running a high-throughput application or a modern L2 
# that has blocks in the 200-500ms range, you may want to increase this value to 
# reduce the number of requests to the node. If you're really cool you will lower
# it and run things as fast as you can.
ttl_latest_ms = 250
# The TTL for the block cache is set to 24 hours. Rather than being concerned with
# liveness in the way that we are for latest, our focus for ttl_block is keeping a 
# hot cache without storing data that you aren't actually using.
ttl_block_ms = 86400000

# QuickNode is a fast, reliable, and pretty affordable Ethereum node provider.
# At Terminally Online we run our own nodes, but QuickNode is our fallback when
# ours is fully saturated or when we need to scale quickly. If you don't already
# have a high-throughput endpoint, go ahead and get one:
#
# → Get yours at: https://quicknode.com/signup?via=chance
[quicknode]
# The second-tier plan of QuickNode maxes out at 125 requests per second, which 
# is sufficient for most use cases. Typically, your only option would be to 
# upgrade your plan, but you are here now so you know what to do.
max_per_second = 100

# Chain support has been completely abstracted away from the codebase. Due to this,
# when you define a new chain, you do that by including a chain name suffix like the
# one below. This allows you to define multiple chains with different providers while
# sharing the configuration of that single provider. Further, in the case that a 
# provider has a chain-agnostic endpoint you can define that by setting the title
# to something like: [quicknode.ethereum,base] or [quicknode.1,8453].
#
# For providers that offer chain-specific URLs, you can use the CHAIN_NAME placeholder
# in your URL configuration. Rapier will automatically replace CHAIN_NAME with the
# actual chain name when creating backends. You can freely combine CHAIN_NAME with
# environment variables in the same URL. For example:
#   url = "https://${QUICKNODE_NAME}.CHAIN_NAME.quiknode.pro/${QUICKNODE_ID}/"
#   This would become: https://your-name.ethereum.quiknode.pro/your-id/ for ethereum
#   And: https://your-name.base.quiknode.pro/your-id/ for base
#
# Environment variables (${VAR_NAME}) are processed first by the system, then CHAIN_NAME
# replacement occurs during backend creation. This allows flexible configurations like:
#   url = "https://${API_HOST}.CHAIN_NAME.${DOMAIN}/${API_KEY}/"
#
# If your URL doesn't contain CHAIN_NAME, Rapier will use the same URL for all chains
# in the configuration, which is the traditional behavior.
